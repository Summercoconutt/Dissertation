    "## 3) Detailed Interpretation of Key Design Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Label-prefixed history (`[LABEL_i]`)\n",
    "History texts are prefixed with `[LABEL_0]`, `[LABEL_1]`, `[LABEL_2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this accomplishes**\n",
    "- Exposes the model to the voter’s historical decisions as part of the textual stream  \n",
    "- Allows the model to learn patterns \n",
    "  - e.g., “voter tends to vote AGAINST on certain types of proposals”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-off / risk**\n",
    "- This injects label information directly into the text channel, which can be powerful but can also:\n",
    "  - cause the model to over-rely on the label token patterns rather than proposal semantics\n",
    "  - reduce interpretability of what it learned\n",
    "\n",
    "If you later want stricter separation, consider providing history labels as **numeric categorical inputs** instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Per-step numeric features\n",
    "For each step, the numeric vector is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[ numeric_cols..., boolean_flags..., time_features(4) ]`\n",
    "\n",
    "So the final per-step dimension is:\n",
    "- `len(numeric_cols)` + `(#boolean cols present)` + `4`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good property**\n",
    "- Features are step-aligned; no future aggregation is used inside the window builder.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Window-level `cluster_id` via mode\n",
    "You set the window’s cluster id to the **most frequent** cluster among its steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is reasonable if:\n",
    "- cluster assignment is stable per voter\n",
    "- occasional missing/noisy cluster values exist\n",
    "\n",
    "**If clusters are constant per voter**, you could simplify:\n",
    "- take the voter’s unique cluster id (e.g., first non-missing value).\n"

    "## 4) Review Notes (Strengths, Risks, and Improvements)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Strengths\n",
    "- Constructs a clean sequence modelling dataset from event-level votes\n",
    "- Enforces chronological ordering per voter\n",
    "- Avoids row-wise mixing by building windows within a voter group\n",
    "- Includes time features and numeric signals alongside text\n",
    "- Outputs are compatible with the `WindowDataset` (Module 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Risks / Potential Issues\n",
    "1) **Column name mismatch for booleans**\n",
    "   - Earlier `normalise_columns` creates canonical columns `is_whale` and `aligned_majority`\n",
    "   - Here you read raw columns `Is Whale` and `Aligned With Majority`\n",
    "   - If you run this on normalised data, these columns may not exist and the booleans will silently be missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Fix:** use canonical names consistently (e.g., `is_whale`, `aligned_majority`) or pass them as parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Text leakage through label prefixes**\n",
    "   - This design is intentional, but you should justify it in documentation.\n",
    "   - Consider ablations: with vs. without label prefixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Imputation default**\n",
    "   - Missing numeric values default to 0.0, which may be semantically incorrect.\n",
    "   - Consider explicit missing flags or per-column imputers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Time encoding**\n",
    "   - Linear normalisation may underperform cyclic encoding.\n",
    "   - Consider sin/cos encoding for periodicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Performance**\n",
    "   - Groupby per voter + per-window loops are Python-level operations.\n",
    "   - For large datasets, this can be slow; may need optimisation or vectorisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended short-term improvements (publication-ready)\n",
    "- Standardise boolean column names across the pipeline\n",
    "- Add asserts:\n",
    "  - `len(texts) == window_size`\n",
    "  - `len(feats) == window_size`\n",
    "  - numeric feature vector length is constant across steps\n",
    "- Add option to include/exclude label prefixes for controlled experiments\n"
